# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
This app uses the input of a US city zip code to display city name, temperature & weather description. It also displays the user's feeling if he chooses to write it, and if there's a problem with the zip code an apropriate error messsage will show up.
Dependencies: Created with MS VS code with node.js (express, cors & body-parser) installed.
